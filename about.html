       Moliabal was founded in 2011 by long time friends <strong>Monica Masini</strong> and <strong>Rosanna Vitella</strong>. <br><br> 
       With Monica’s flare for design and Rosanna’s renowned logistical experience they decided to start a great adventure and launched the first Italian range dedicated to <strong style="color:black">luxury hair accessories</strong>. <br><br>
       
       <strong style="color:black">Handmade in Italy</strong> from the highest quality resin, Moliabal hair accessories are lightweight and comfortable. <br><br> 
       Timeless and sophisticated, the core collection is black and white, with additional pieces in tortoiseshell, ivory &amp; black and red &amp; black. Silk, chiffon, crystals and beads are also used throughout the collections.<br><br>
       
       <br>Six years on Moliabal’s aim is to offer a full range of luxury fashion accessories. To this end we have now expanded our range to include <strong style="color:black">clutch bags</strong> and <strong style="color:black">beauty bags</strong> and in the future we will be launching our first <strong style="color:black">luxury fashion jewellery collection</strong>. <br><br>
       
       Monica , Founder and General Manager of Moliabal, explains that her inspiration for the Moliabal beauty bags came from a Versace outfit from the 80’s that she found in her mother’s wardrobe. <br><br>
        Remembering the touch of this incredibly soft and light mesh material she decided to create the collection which offers basic models as well as more stylish pieces embellished with crystals. <br><br>
       
       Designs such as the Teddy bear, Love, Make up, Lady Bug and Luck are cute contemporary, trendy and fun….yet timeless. <br><br>
       
       <strong>The name Moliabal</strong> was created whilst Monica was discussing her ideas for a new and exciting range of hair accessories with three of her best friends……and is made up of the initial letters of their names : <strong>MONICA, LICIA, ABELE, ALBERTO</strong>.
